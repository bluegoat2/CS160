        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Environmental Damage</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Wildfires rapidly destroy forests, grasslands, and wildlife habitats. They remove critical vegetation that prevents soil erosion and destabilize entire ecosystems. Recovery can take decades, and some species may never fully return to burned areas.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Economic Loss</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Wildfires cause billions of dollars in damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure each year. Firefighting efforts themselves are costly, and local economies, especially those relying on agriculture or tourism, often suffer long-term setbacks.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Public Health Risks</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Wildfire smoke contains fine matter that can reach deep into the lungs, leading to respiratory issues, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, are especially at risk during fire events.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Emotional and Psychological Effects</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Survivors of wildfires often experience trauma, anxiety, and depression. The sudden loss of homes, possessions, and sometimes loved ones leaves emotional scars. Recovery involves not only rebuilding structures but also rebuilding lives and mental health.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Long-Term Recovery Challenges</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          After the flames are extinguished, communities face years of recovery efforts. Insurance claims, rebuilding projects, and infrastructure repairs are slow and expensive. Environmental degradation can prolong recovery and make areas more vulnerable to future disasters.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Air Quality and Global Impact</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Wildfires significantly worsen air quality across vast regions, even hundreds of miles away. In addition to immediate health effects, the carbon emissions from wildfires contribute to global climate change, creating a dangerous feedback loop of more frequent and intense fires.

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Community Displacement</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Entire communities are sometimes forced to evacuate, leaving behind homes and livelihoods. Displacement disrupts education, employment, and social networks, placing additional stress on affected populations and increasing the difficulty of recovery.
